# Impulse Blocker
Firefox extension that blocks websites that you don't want to visit. Use for procrastination.

Written using [WebExtensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions) so it will be compatible with the future releases of Firefox.
Currently it is not in the official [add-ons page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/). You can install it temporarily by first downloading the source code 
and then [temporarily add](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2015/12/23/loading-temporary-add-ons/) to Firefox using [about:debugging](about:debugging) page.
